Quick start (combined project with streaming):

1. Extract the zip and open a terminal.
2. cd AI_Chatbot_Complete/server
3. npm install
4. Rename .env.example -> .env and paste your OpenAI key:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
5. npm start
6. Open http://localhost:3000/realtime-chatbot.html in your browser
7. Type messages and watch the bot 'type' responses live.

Notes:
- The server proxies requests to OpenAI and forwards stream chunks via Server-Sent Events.
- If your prompt is very long, consider using the POST endpoint /api/chat (non-streaming) instead.
- Do not expose your API key in client code or public repos.
